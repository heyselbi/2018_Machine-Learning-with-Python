# 2018_Machine-Learning-with-Python #

My jupyter notebooks from "Machine Learning with Python" workshop taken in Fall 2018 are published in this repository. Three-day workshop was organized by the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences (also called QCBio) at UCLA.

Full contents of the workshop can be found here:

Below is the description:
In this workshop, we explore applications of Machine Learning to analyze biological data without the need of advanced programming skills. For example, Machine Learning techniques can be used to construct predictive models based on a set of training examples, to remove noise and spurious artifacts from data (e.g. photobleaching), or to help visualize trends within high dimensional datasets, etc. This workshop will cover the basic principles involved in the applications mentioned above, such as pattern recognition, linear and non-linear regression and cluster analysis. The workshop will be oriented towards hands-on activities, starting from the basics of how to load and prepare biological datasets in a Python environment. By the end of this workshop, students will be able to use Scikit-Learnâ€™s documentation (and other libraries) to build models based on their own data, assess their performance and make new predictions. Students are encouraged to attend to the Advanced Python and Modern Statistics workshops, although no advanced knowledge will be assumed.
